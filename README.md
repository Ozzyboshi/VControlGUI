# VControlGUI

VControlGUI is a very small utility that lets you send commands to flype's VControl software.
VControl allows us to tweak Vampire card behaviours according to the needs of the user.
VControlGUI is a project by Vampire Italia, visit our forum for more Vampire stuff : https://vampireitalia.forumfree.it/

### Requirements
- Any vampire card
- Vcontrol installed and in path
- Any amigaos (tested only on AmigaOS 3.1.4 and Coffin)

### Features
VControlGUI offers the same features that VControl provides (something is still missin, maybe they will implemented in the future like the Akiko mode ON/OFF).

This is a list of most relevant features:
- Kickstart selection
- SuperScalar mode ON/OFF
- TurtlemodeÂ mode ON/OFF
- CPU detection
- VBR address detection- Ide speed tweaking

VControlGUI is OS friendly and it relies on Intuition library.

### Vcontrol in action
